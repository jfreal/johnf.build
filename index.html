                    TypeScript) ecosystem. </p>

                                <p>I strongly believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership"

                                    At a lot of companies, too much of the software process is counting closed tickets
                                    or
                                    lines of code. Not enough leaders take the time to ask, "Hey, how are
                                    <em>you</em>?".

                                <p>Software is easy, humans are the hard part, and I enjoy the challenge and rewards
                                    that
                                    come with leadership roles.

                                    At BTE, LLC I hired and built a team of ten developers and project managers.
                                    The team grew from a single person development to a team of team contributing to

                        My career has always revolved around growing businesses. I've been an early stage employee
                        several times, have started my own companies, and helped businesses get off the ground as a

                        an e-commerce application from scratch that generated more sales than the physical store.

                                As a small business owner with limited technical knowledge finding a software developer
                                who
                                can
                                understand your business needs and turn them into usable functioning software is very
                                difficult. John has done an <strong>extraordinary job of sitting down with me,
                                    analyzing my problems, and using outside the box thinking to come up with creative
                                    solutions to

                                of what I want and then he spends the time to figure out what the problem is and how to
                                solve
                                it. Many other developers stray down the wrong path and waste your money because they
                                don’t
                                fully understand your needs.

                                If John is not 100% sure of the direction he is headed he will setup a meeting to
                                discuss
                                and
                                gain full clarity before proceeding forward. The main application that John has created

                                not having it at this point. It has been a pleasure working with John and I look forward
                                to
                                working with him for years to come.
