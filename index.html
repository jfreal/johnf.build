                                <p>The most rewarding professional experiences I've had is when I built, grew, and
                                    nurtured a ten person engineering organization. </p>
                                <p>I strongly believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership"

                                <p>
                                    At a lot of companies, too much of the software process is counting closed tickets
                                    or
                                    lines of code. Not enough leaders take the time to ask, "Hey, how are
                                    <em>you</em>?".
                                </p>
                                <p>Software is easy, humans are the hard part, and I enjoy the challenge and rewards
                                    that
                                    come with leadership roles.

                                    Thailand for a dinner.
                                    At BTE, LLC I hired and built a team of ten developers and project managers.
                                    The team grew from a single person development to a team of team contributing to
                                    various

                    <p>
                        My career has always revolved around growing businesses. I've been an early stage employee
                        several times, have started my own companies, and helped businesses get off the ground as a
                        freelance client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first web development job I had was helping an e-commerce business grow from celebrating two
                        days of consecutive
                        orders
                        to a having a suite of e-commerce websites
                        and running out of space in their warehouse. üôå
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I transitioned to the C# and .NET ecosystem from PHP, my first contract was
                        developing
                        an e-commerce application from scratch that generated more sales than the physical store.

                                it. Many other developers stray down the wrong path and waste your money because they

                                gain full clarity before proceeding forward. The main application that John has created
